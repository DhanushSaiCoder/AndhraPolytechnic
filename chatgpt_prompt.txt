**Prompt for ChatGPT**

**Context:** I am a large language model assisting a user in redesigning a web application's admin interface. The user was unhappy with my previous design attempt, calling it "amateurish" with "oversized text inputs". I need your expert advice on UI/UX design to create a better layout.

**The Task:** Redesign the "Faculty Entry" and "Lab Details Entry" sections within a modal form. These sections are dynamic, meaning the user can add or remove multiple faculty members or labs.

**Original Layout:**
Each item (a faculty member or a lab) is displayed in a vertical stack. For a faculty member, it looks like this:
-   Name (text input)
-   Designation (text input)
-   Specialization (text input)
-   Image Upload (text input for URL + upload button)
-   Image Preview
-   Socials (dynamic list of text inputs for type and URL)
-   Remove button

Here is the JSX for the original faculty section:
```jsx
<div className="form-section">
  <h4>Faculty</h4>
  {currentDepartment.faculty.map((member, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="dynamic-object-item bordered-section">
      <h5>Faculty Member #{index + 1}</h5>
      <input type="text" value={member.name} placeholder="Name" />
      <input type="text" value={member.designation} placeholder="Designation" />
      <input type="text" value={member.specialization} placeholder="Specialization" />
      <div className="image-input-group">
        <input type="text" readOnly placeholder="Upload an image to see the URL" />
        <input type="file" style={{ display: 'none' }} />
        <button type="button" className="btn-icon" title="Upload Image">
          <Upload size={20} />
        </button>
      </div>
      {/* Image preview here */}
      
      <h6>Socials</h6>
      {/* Socials list here */}
      
      <button type="button" className="remove-btn" style={{marginTop: '10px'}}>Remove Faculty Member</button>
    </div>
  ))}
  <button type="button" className="add-btn">Add Faculty Member</button>
</div>
```

**My Failed Redesign:**
I tried to create a two-column layout for each item:
-   **Left Column:** Image upload and preview.
-   **Right Column:** Text inputs for Name, Designation, and Specialization.
-   **Below Columns:** A section for social media links.

The user felt this resulted in "oversized text inputs" and looked "amateurish". This might be due to my use of flexbox (`flex: 1` for the left column, `flex: 2` for the right) which might have stretched the inputs too much.

**The Goal:**
I need a professional and clean design for these form sections. The layout should be intuitive, space-efficient, and visually appealing. It needs to handle potentially many entries for faculty and labs gracefully.

**Question for you, ChatGPT:**
1.  Please suggest 2-3 alternative layouts for these repeating form sections (Faculty and Labs).
2.  For each layout, please describe the arrangement of elements (text inputs, image upload, buttons).
3.  Provide advice on spacing, alignment, and other CSS properties to avoid the "amateurish" look and "oversized inputs".
4.  Suggest how to handle the nested list of "Socials" within a faculty member entry in a clean way.
5.  If possible, provide simple JSX/HTML and CSS examples for your proposed layouts.

I am looking for practical design advice that I can translate into React components and CSS. Thank you.
