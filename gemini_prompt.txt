You are a content writer for a government polytechnic institution.
The institution is named 'Andhra Polytechnic'.
I need a new title and a subtitle for the hero section of its official website's homepage.
The current title is 'Welcome to Andhra Polytechnic' and the current subtitle is 'A Premier Institution for Technical Education and Innovation.'
The tone should be formal, prominent, and convey the importance and quality of the institution, suitable for a government-style website.
Please provide 3-5 options for a new title and subtitle pair.
Each option should include both English and Hindi translations.
The title should be concise and impactful.
The subtitle should elaborate on the institution's mission or benefits.

Example format:
Option 1:
Title (English): [Title suggestion]
Title (Hindi): [Title suggestion in Hindi]
Subtitle (English): [Subtitle suggestion]
Subtitle (Hindi): [Subtitle suggestion in Hindi]
